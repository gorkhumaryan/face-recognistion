Face Recognition System (FaceNet + Cosine Similarity)
Overview

This project implements a face recognition system using a pretrained FaceNet model.

🔁 Pipeline
Image → 512D Embedding → Cosine Similarity vs Gallery → Identity or "Unknown"

The system supports open-set recognition, meaning it can detect unknown individuals.

Features

✅ Pretrained FaceNet (VGGFace2 weights)

✅ Cosine similarity matching

✅ Threshold tuning using validation set

✅ Open-set evaluation (unknown detection)

✅ ROC curve and AUC analysis

Installation

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Notes

Dataset images are assumed to be cropped faces.

Performance may decrease under real-world conditions (lighting, blur, occlusion).

Model weights are not included in the repository.
